## Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the project environment and install the required dependencies:
### Step 1: Clone the repository

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/padhariabhavesh/ML_AI.git

### Step 2: Set up a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately from your global Python environment.

# On Windows
python -m venv env

### Step 3: Activate the virtual environment

Activate the virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are installed in an isolated environment.

# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate

### Step 4: Install dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

### Step 5: Run the scripts

You can now run the project scripts, such as:

python Data_Preprocessing.py
